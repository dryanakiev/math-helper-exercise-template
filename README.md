# math-helper-exercise-template

Write a MathHelper class that contains two methods: Factorial and Fibonacci. The Factorial method takes an integer value as input and returns its factorial value. The Fibonacci method takes an integer value as input and returns its corresponding Fibonacci number.

Then, write unit tests to ensure that both methods are working correctly. Your tests should cover a range of scenarios, including:

1. Testing for correct factorial calculation of a simple number.
2. Testing for correct factorial calculation of a larger number.
3. Testing for correct Fibonacci number calculation of a simple number.
4. Testing for correct Fibonacci number calculation of a larger number.
5. Testing for correct handling of negative input values.

Here's a sample code structure to get you started:

```
public class MathHelper {
  public int Factorial(int n) {
    // TODO: Implement factorial calculation
  }

  public int Fibonacci(int n) {
    // TODO: Implement Fibonacci number calculation
  }
}

[TestFixture]
public class MathHelperTests {
  [Test]
  public void TestFactorial() {
    // TODO: Write test for factorial calculation
  }

  [Test]
  public void TestFibonacci() {
    // TODO: Write test for Fibonacci number calculation
  }
}
```

Your task is to complete the TODO comments with the appropriate code to implement the Factorial and Fibonacci methods and write the unit tests to verify their correctness. Good luck!
